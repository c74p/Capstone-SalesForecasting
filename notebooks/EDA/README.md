A NOTE ON NOTEBOOKS -- JUPYTER VS CAULDRON

For reasons that are detailed in the root README.md, I used
Cauldron notebooks for the data wrangling and EDA portions of this project.

If you want to see meaningful outputs, you have three easy options:

    Option 1: check within this directory for a folder called 'html' - within
	that directory will be an html file where you can see all the visuals.

    Option 2: go to http://unnotebook.com/reader-install/ and install the
	reader, and point it to the data_wrangling.cauldron file in this
	directory. The install is actually fast and easy, and the visuals look
	the best in this format. 

    Option 3: check this directory for a pdf that I've printed from the
	Cauldron notebook. This is just visuals without code, and the visuals
	aren't as good as the other two options.
